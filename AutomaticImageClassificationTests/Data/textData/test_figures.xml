        <CAPTION>Screenshot of CN state comparison visualisation mode . The CN state comparison of 30 healthy subjects is reported. Only the CN state comparison of autosome chromosomes is shown. SNPs with a diploid state (CN state 2) in all samples are in black; SNPs with a CN state lower than 2 (deleted) in all the samples are in blue; SNPs with a CN state lower than 2 in only some samples are in yellow; SNPs with a CN state greater than 2 (duplicated) in all the samples are in red; SNPs with a CN state greater than 2 in only some samples are in pink; and SNPs that were simultaneously duplicated and deleted in different samples are in green. In this figure, a duplication (pink) common to some samples is highlighted by an arrow. The position of one of the SNPs belonging to the highlighted deletion is reported at the bottom of the window. In the figure, a "Probe data" window is also reported. This window can be opened by double-clicking on any SNPs/squares visualised, and it displays the intensity value and the genotype of all compared samples for that particular SNP.</CAPTION>

        <CAPTION>TieredNeoMap . The TieredNeoMap is a specialized subclass of NeoMap that allows developers to display data in labeled tracks. Typically, this functionality is used to segregate data sets arising from different sources so that users can compare them easily.</CAPTION>

        <CAPTION>1D-NMR spectra . MetaboLab graphical user interface showing an overlay of 329 1D-NMR spectra of extracted tissue biopsies before (large spectra) and after post-processing (insert spectra). Spectra from cancerous tissue are plotted in blue while those originating from control samples are shown in red. The NMR spectra were aligned to TMSP, baseline corrected and the water region and regions without peaks were excluded. The spectra were then scaled to the total spectral area and re-aligned with respect to the first spectrum.</CAPTION>
